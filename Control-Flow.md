# Control Flow

JS / TS have many ways to control the flow of a program. In readme.md we explained why `if`, `switch`, and imperative loops like `for` are poor ways to control flow. `for` uses mutation to run loops - which is something that we try to avoid. `if` and `switch` lead to a tangled mix of Conditional Logic, Code Blocks, Mutiple Returns, and Hard-to-track Mutation.

We've been introduced to some better alternatives including:

- Ternaries
- Short Circuits
- Conditionals ( Utilising **The Prelude** + **Maybe Library** )
