# Control Flow

JS / TS have many ways to control the flow of a program. In readme.md we explained why `if`, `switch`, and imperative loops like `for` are poor ways to control flow. `for` uses mutation to run loops - which is something that we try to avoid. `if` and `switch` lead to a tangled mix of Conditional Logic, Code Blocks, Mutiple Returns, and Hard-to-track Mutation.

We've been introduced to some better alternatives including:

- Ternaries
- Short Circuits
- üå∂Ô∏è  &nbsp; üß© &nbsp; Conditionals ( Utilising **The Prelude** + **Maybe Library** )

So what's the difference between them and which should you use?

Ternaries and Short Circuits are native and require nothing to get started - however Conditionals are often cleaner and more powerful.

So for simple logic, use ternaries...

```

const a = 10

const b =
  a === 10
    ? 'exactly 10'
    : a < 10
      ? 'less than 10'
      : 'greater than 10'
```

Where ternaries are good for logic that of `return a if x or b if y`, short-circuits are best for guards and checks.

```
const a = 10

a === 10 || die(`a cannot be 10`)

```
